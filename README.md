# README Generator

## Description
For this Project I was given starter code for a professional readme generator that can be run out of node.js. This application prompts a user with questions about their project and the license they wish to give it to create a very interactive and professioal looking readme. I created this project using only javascript and npm inquirer as well as node.js. I have also provided a walkthrough video to teach a developer how to use this application.
